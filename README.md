## Introduction

SnapNews is a quiz app that utilizes BBC news RSS. Users select from a group of thumbnails, the image that best matches a provided headline. It's a fun and interactive way to test your knowledge and stay updated with the latest news.

## Inspiration

I initialy designed this app for people who wish to get used to reading news in English, especially ESL students.

When I first came to Canada, my classmates and I always grabbed a newspaper at a train station and tried to read them, even though sometimes it was hard to understand the meaning. We encountered a lot of new words through newspapers, and it was a great ways to learn English.

By creating a news quiz app, I'm hoping to help learners to have a time to think about what headline means, while choosing the answer among different thumbnails.
