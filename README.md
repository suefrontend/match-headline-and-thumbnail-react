## Introduction
This is a quiz app called Match Headline and Thumbnail. Users select from a group of thumbnails, the image that best matches a provided headline. News data comes from CBC RSS in xml format, and it is translated to JSON via RSS to JSON online converter.

## Inspiration
I initialy designed this app for people who wish to get used to reading news in English, especially ESL students. 

When I first came to Canada, my classmates and I always grabbed a newspaper at a train station and tried to read them, even though sometimes it was hard to understand the meaning. We encountered a lot of new words through newspapers, and it was a great ways to learn English.

By creating a news quiz app, I'm hoping to help learners to have a time to think about what headline means, while choosing the answer among different thumbnails.

## How to Run the Project

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
